## 🔧 Advanced Workflows

### Validation Workflow (NEW! - Recommended Best Practice)

```
I want to add a new VBA function to test.xlsm. Follow this workflow:

1. First, validate this code:
   Function MultiplyNumbers(a As Double, b As Double) As Double
       MultiplyNumbers = a * b
   End Function

2. If validation passes, extract the current code from TestModule

3. Add the new function to the existing code

4. Validate the complete updated code

5. If validation passes, inject the updated code into test.xlsm

6. List all macros to confirm the new function is there

7. Run MultiplyNumbers with arguments 15 and 4 to test it
```
**Expected:** Validation catches errors before injection, ensuring clean workflow

### Excel Table Processing Workflow (NEW!)

```
I need to work with the sales data in test.xlsm. Follow this workflow:

1. Open test.xlsm in Excel

2. Create an Excel table from range A1:D20 on Sheet1, name it "SalesData"

3. List all tables to confirm it was created

4. Get the data from columns ["Product", "Revenue"] in SalesData table

5. Insert a new column named "Profit" after column D in the table

6. Calculate profit (Revenue * 0.3) and write it to the Profit column

7. Insert 5 new rows at the end of the table for new entries

8. Delete any rows where Revenue is 0

9. Close and save the file
```
**Expected:** Complete table manipulation workflow demonstrating CRUD operations

### Extract, Modify, Inject

```
1. Extract the VBA code from TestModule in test.xlsm
2. Add a new function called SquareNumber that takes a number and returns its square
3. Validate the modified code first
4. Inject the modified code back into test.xlsm
5. Run SquareNumber with argument 12
```

### Data Processing Pipeline

```
1. Open test.xlsm
2. Get all data from Sheet1
3. Calculate the average age and average score
4. Write a summary to Sheet2 with the calculated averages
5. Close and save the file
```

### Refactoring Suggestions

```
Analyze the VBA code in test.xlsm and suggest refactoring improvements

## 🎯 Real-World Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Legacy Code Analysis

```
I have an old Excel file with VBA macros. Can you:
1. List all the modules
2. Extract and analyze the code
3. Identify potential issues or improvements
4. Suggest modern alternatives

File: C:\path\to\your\file.xlsm
```

### Scenario 2: Automated Data Processing

```
I need to:
1. Open budget.xlsm
2. Run the CalculateMonthlyTotals macro
3. Get the results from Summary sheet
4. Export that data to a new file

Can you help?
```

### Scenario 3: Macro Debugging

```
I have a macro in invoices.xlsm called GenerateReport that's not working.
Can you:
1. Extract the code
2. Analyze it for errors
3. Suggest fixes
4. Test it with sample data
```

## ⚡ Pro Tips

1. **Keep files open:** After opening a file, you can run multiple operations without reopening (faster!)

2. **Session timeout:** Files auto-close after 1 hour of inactivity

3. **Backups:** Injection creates automatic backups with timestamp

4. **Large data:** For data > 10,000 cells, specify exact range for better performance

5. **Formulas:** Use `include_formulas: true` to get formulas instead of values

6. **Excel Tables:** Use table names for structured data - easier column selection and automatic range updates

7. **Column references:** Use letters (A, B) or numbers (1, 2) for columns - tables also support header names

8. **Bulk operations:** Delete multiple columns at once by passing a list of header names to tables

## 🐛 If Something Goes Wrong

### Quick Fixes:

**"Cannot run macro"**
→ Check Excel Trust Settings (see SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md Step 1)

**"File is locked"**
→ Close the file in Excel manually

**"No MCP servers connected"**
→ Restart Claude Code, check config file

**Macro doesn't return value**
→ It might be a Sub (no return) instead of Function (has return)
